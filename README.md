autokey-mac-keybindings

Get mac key bindings in linux.

For example: <super>+c, <super>+v and lots of other bindings. Check in 'Mac Keybindings' folder.
Tried in Ubuntu and it seems to work.

autokey usually places config in ~/.config/autokey, this is where the files should be...

Ubuntu has som <super> key shortcuts that needs to be removed otherwise you'll see some weird behaviour.
Check in Settings > Devices > Keyboard Shortcuts, search for 'super'.
